setup on my pc

esp32 board version 2.0.0

library manager:

-installed adafruit GFX Library 1.11.0

-installed ArduinoWebSockets 0.4.5 (dont think newest code uses it)


If fb_forward.h not working, check through this guide? https://techtutorialsx.com/2020/06/13/esp32-camera-face-detection/ 


use accessPointWebServer

everything should be up and running on the esp32-cam as is, but if we want to change anything we need to have the settings/installations above.
